USER FLOW:

1. LANDING/SESSIONS PAGE (First Screen):
   - Display list of existing game sessions (if any)
   - Prominent "Create New Session" button
   - Each session card shows:
     * Session name (e.g., "Monday Night Badminton", "Weekend Warriors")
     * Date created
     * Number of players
     * Quick stats (last played, total games)
   - Click session to enter its dashboard
   - Option to edit/delete sessions
   - Quick access to most recent session

2. CREATE SESSION FLOW:
   - Modal/page to create new session
   - Required fields:
     * Session name
     * Optional: description, location, recurring schedule
   - Auto-creates session and navigates to dashboard
   - Session data stored separately in localStorage

3. DASHBOARD (Session Home):
   - Shows current session name at top
   - Navigation back to sessions list
   - Main sections:
     * Player management
     * Match generation
     * Court setup
     * Active matches
     * Quick stats

KEY FUNCTIONALITY:

1. SESSION MANAGEMENT:
   - Create multiple independent game sessions
   - Each session has its own players, matches, and settings
   - Switch between sessions easily
   - Delete sessions
   - Reset session: reset all games count to 0 and move all players to Queue
   - Reset button with confirmation dialog

2. PLAYER MANAGEMENT:
   - Add/edit/delete players (per session)
   - Set skill category: Starter, Intermediate, or Pro
   - Add player gender (Male, Female, Other)
   - Toggle player states: Queue, Playing, Break
   - Switch players between Playing and Queue with drag-and-drop or buttons
   - Track games played per player
   - Bulk actions: Move multiple players to Queue/Playing/Break

3. MATCH GENERATION (Multiple Modes):
   - BALANCED MODE: Pair high-skill with low-skill players
   - NON-BALANCED MODE: Group similar skill levels together
   - GENDER-BASED MODE: Create gender-balanced teams (mixed doubles)
   - GENDER-SPECIFIC MODE: Male-only or Female-only matches
   - RANDOM MODE: Fisher-Yates shuffle for variety
   - Fair rotation: Prioritize players with fewer games
   - Auto-adjust to available courts

4. COURT MANAGEMENT:
   - Configure 1-5 courts dynamically (per session)
   - Customizable court names (e.g., "Court A", "Center Court", "Practice Court")
   - Edit court names inline or in settings
   - Optimize court usage based on available players
   - Visual court status indicators
   - Save custom court names to localStorage

5. BASIC TRACKING:
   - Games played per player
   - Current matches display with court names
   - Player queue status
   - Simple match history

6. UI/UX:
   - Clean, modern interface
   - Dark/light theme toggle
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Skill categories displayed with badges/chips (use Replit's theme colors)
   - Drag-and-drop interface for player management

MATCH GENERATION ALGORITHM:
- Sort players by games played (ascending) for fair rotation
- Apply selected generation mode:
  * BALANCED: Pair Pro with Starter, Intermediate with Intermediate
  * NON-BALANCED: Group Pro together, Intermediate together, Starter together
  * GENDER-BASED: Ensure 2 males + 2 females per match (mixed doubles)
  * GENDER-SPECIFIC: Only males or only females per match
  * RANDOM: Shuffle fairly using Fisher-Yates algorithm
- Ensure 4 players per match (doubles format)
- Fill courts efficiently based on available players
- Update games played count after match generation

DATA MODELS:
```typescript
interface Session {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  location?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  lastPlayedAt?: Date;
  players: Player[];
  courts: Court[];
  matches: Match[];
  settings: SessionSettings;
}

interface Player {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  skillCategory: 'Starter' | 'Intermediate' | 'Pro';
  gender: 'Male' | 'Female' | 'Other';
  gamesPlayed: number;
  status: 'Queue' | 'Playing' | 'Break';
  isCore: boolean;
}

interface Court {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  defaultName: string; // e.g., "Court 1", "Court 2"
  isActive: boolean;
}

interface Match {
  id: string;
  courtId: string;
  courtName: string;
  team1: [Player, Player];
  team2: [Player, Player];
  status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
  generatedAt: Date;
}

interface SessionSettings {
  defaultCourts: number;
  defaultMatchMode: 'balanced' | 'non-balanced' | 'gender-based' | 'gender-specific' | 'random';
}
```

MATCH GENERATION SETTINGS UI:
- Mode selector dropdown with 5 options
- Court count selector (1-5)
- Court name editor (click to edit each court name)
- "Generate Matches" button
- Display mode description on selection

PLAYER STATUS SWITCHING:
- Visual sections for "Queue", "Playing", and "Break"
- Click player to toggle between Queue ↔ Playing
- Drag-and-drop players between status sections
- Quick action buttons: "Move to Queue", "Move to Playing", "Set Break"
- When match is generated, automatically move selected players to "Playing" status
- After match completion, prompt to move players back to "Queue"

NAVIGATION STRUCTURE:
1. App loads → Sessions List Page
2. User creates session → Auto-navigate to Dashboard
3. User clicks existing session → Navigate to Dashboard
4. Dashboard shows: Session name, Back button, Main controls
5. Settings/court management accessible from Dashboard

Make the app production-ready with proper error handling, TypeScript types, and performance optimizations.
